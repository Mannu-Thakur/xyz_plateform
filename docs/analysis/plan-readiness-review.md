# Plan Readiness Analysis — bugX Platform

Analysis of whether the phased implementation plan is ready to build (pre-implementation review).

**Verdict:** Implementation-ready after documented fixes and final hardening (see [plan-fixes-applied.md](./plan-fixes-applied.md)).

## Phase boundaries

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Build order 1→2→3→4→5→6 | Documented in backend README |
| Phase 4 worker does not call `ScoringService` | Explicit boundary |
| Phase 3 `user_status` stub; Phase 4+ live | Clear |
| Phase 5 scoring as final worker step | Clear |
| Seed after Phase 3 migrations | Clear |

## Strengths

- Single **Resolved decisions** table in backend README
- Full API contract in `07-api-routes.md`
- Seed spec with all test I/O for 5 problems
- Phase 4 / 5 worker split avoids premature scoring
- Self-checklist in `13-plan-verification.md`

## Issues found (before fixes)

| Severity | Issue |
|----------|--------|
| High | `docker-compose.yml` location contradicted (repo root vs `backend/`) |
| High | Stale `RUNNING` reclaim could duplicate `submission_results` |
| Medium | Admin allowed `javascript` + `kwargs` but no JS wrapper |
| Low | Pagination `pages` when `total=0` ambiguous |
| Low | No Judge0 field on health in Phase 4+ |
| Low | Scoring recovery path undefined |

## Issues found in final review and fixed

| Severity | Issue |
|----------|--------|
| High | Judge0 compose showed only API server, not execution workers |
| Medium | Admin numeric/test validation could allow zero/negative scoring fields or broken JSON test data |
| Medium | Phase 6 startup order could start API/worker before migrations and seed |
| Medium | Missing `email-validator` dependency for Pydantic `EmailStr` |
| Medium | Compose `api`/`worker` used `build: .` before a `Dockerfile` was specified |

## Intentional design gaps (not bugs)

- Between Phase 4 and 5: `ACCEPTED` with `score=0`, `solved=true`, `best_score=null` until scoring runs
- Single worker replica in v1
- Judge0 language IDs must be verified per CE image

## Phase-by-phase readiness

| Phase | Ready? |
|-------|--------|
| 1 Setup | Yes (after compose path fix) |
| 2 Auth | Yes |
| 3 Problems + seed | Yes |
| 4 Judge | Yes (after reclaim/idempotency spec) |
| 5 Scoring | Yes |
| 6 Frontend | Yes |

## Verification

Automated checklist: [../backend/13-plan-verification.md](../backend/13-plan-verification.md) — **50/50 pass** after fixes.
